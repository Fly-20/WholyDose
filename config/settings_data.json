Our products contain clinically-proven ingredients that go through testing for safety and to ensure high purity.\n\nAll of our products are gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, sugar-free, and are keto and paleo friendly.<\/p>"}},"1588541881399":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF YOUR COLLAGEN?","faqa":"<p>Our marine collagen is sourced from non-GMO tilapia and pangasius fish from Europe and is Kosher certified. Our bovine collagen is sourced from non-GMO, grass-fed, pasture-raised, antibiotic-free cattle from South America.<br><br>Both types of collagen are sustainably sourced and don't contain any fillers or preservatives.<\/p>"}},"1588630888255":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"IS YOUR COLLAGEN CLINICALLY PROVEN?","faqa":"<p>Yes! The collagen we use is clinically proven to improve skin elasticity and smoothness, increase firmness and hydration, reduce wrinkles, improve hair health, and strengthen joints, bones, and muscles in as little as 4-8 weeks. Additionally, it supports nail, digestive, and immune health.<br><br>Studies have also been conducted using our collagen to show it is highly effective and highly bioavailable (easily absorbed by the body).<\/p>"}},"1588630927272":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"IS YOUR COLLAGEN HIGHLY BIOAVAILABLE?","faqa":"<p>Yes. Our collagen is highly bioavailable and goes through hydrolysis - a carefully controlled process that breaks down collagen molecules into smaller units so it can be easily digested and absorbed by the body. In fact, studies have been conducted on the collagen we use, showing that it is, indeed, easily absorbed and digested by the body.<\/p>"}},"1588630943902":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR HYDROLYSIS PROCESS","faqa":"<p>An international team of scientists uses the most advanced technology for our collagen's hydrolysis process of sterilization, pasteurization, ultrafiltration, and crystallization to ensure validated, safe, and effective methods.<br><br>These experts are constantly seeking new and improved ways to develop and offer the highest quality of collagen so, we can provide it for you.<\/p>"}},"1588630967503":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"WHY ARE YOUR PRODUCTS IN POWDER FORM INSTEAD OF PILLS?","faqa":"<p>Simply put, we don&rsquo;t like the feeling or aftertaste of swallowing pills - we also understand that a pill regimen can be easily forgotten or deliberately avoided.

It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening on the inside that counts. Our ingredients collaboratively improve your overall health and wellbeing - happier mood, sustained energy, mental clarity, better digestion, and lessened cravings, to name a few. Generally speaking, it takes 2-4 months for our bodies to reach a new equilibrium - external factors such as skin and hair may take up to this amount of time to see a distinct difference.<br><br>That said, we suggest keeping track of your progress by taking a photo before using our products and a photo after each month of use.

This is likely due to your body not being used to the way the amino acids in collagen are broken down by your stomach. Not to worry though! Once your stomach is used to breaking down collagen, the digestive discomfort should no longer be of concern.<\/p>"}},"1588631174170":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"WHAT DOES UNFLAVORED BEAUTY SUPERFOOD POWDER TASTE LIKE?","faqa":"<p>UNFLAVORED Beauty Superfood Powder is neutral in taste and great for adding to beverages and recipes.<\/p>"}},"1588631224236":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"WHAT DOES MATCHA BEAUTY SUPERFOOD POWDER TASTE LIKE?","faqa":"<p>MATCHA Beauty Superfood Powder tastes like green tea, but is more aromatic and fuller in flavor.<\/p>"}},"1588631237569":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"WHAT DOES BEAUTY TONIC SUPERPOWDER TASTE LIKE?","faqa":"<p>BEAUTY TONIC Superpowder has a slight pomegranate taste and is great for adding to water and other beverages.<\/p>"}},"1588631256280":{"type":"shipping","settings":{"faqq":"HOW MUCH DOES SHIPPING COST?","faqa":"<p>Standard shipping for orders: $4.95 - $6.95, unless otherwise noted.<br>Expedited shipping options are available for an additional fee and will be listed at checkout.<\/p>"}},"1588631272919":{"type":"shipping","settings":{"faqq":"HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR MY ORDER TO ARRIVE?","faqa":"<p>Orders ship within 1-3 business days from the date of purchase, unless otherwise noted.
