At Wholy Dose, we're redefining beauty: what beauty means, looks like, and should feel like.\n<br><br>\nTraditional beauty products weren't doing us any good. They all tried to cover up who we are, instead of improving what was on the inside. Which, led us to discovering the power of ingestible beauty.\n<br><br>\nMore than a beauty product, a mission we stand by – Because you’re the only person who can define your beauty. Beauty not founded in comparison, but self-acceptance, self-progress, and self-love.\n<br><br>\nOur products help you achieve self-acceptance, through supplementing the natural beautifying and healthy properties already in you, and self-progress, through the continuous journey of improving yourself, inside and out, ultimately achieving self-love, so you can feel comfortable and confident in your own skin, at all times.\n<br><br>\nThe notion of perfection and comparison are unmeasurable, but working on yourself through self-progress, that's real.","block2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Founder_Gina_Holzer_Headshot_Story_Photos.png","content2title":"Meet Our Founder, Gina","content2":"I spent the majority of my early life trying to change the way I looked and felt about myself — I yearned for perfect skin, thicker hair and longer lashes. This notion of wanting to look different simply because I wasn’t satisfied with my genetics led me to always wear makeup whenever I left the house, even if that meant getting the mail from outside.\n<br><br>\nAfter spending 10 years trying countless products in hopes they would improve my complexion and hair, no products – topicals, vitamins, and even changing my diet – gave me these results. \n<br><br>\nEventually, I started experimenting with supplements in the kitchen of my New York City apartment, and it was then that I came to discover a formula which we now call the Wholy Grail – A blend of ingredients that gives your body what it needs to look and feel your best. It improved my skin, thickened my hair, and changed the way I felt. I noticed a significant change in my gut health and immunity as it overturned a lifetime of constant stomach aches and bi-yearly colds – I also felt different about myself, and how I defined beauty. ","content3":"Beauty isn’t about looking the best, it’s about looking and feeling your best. By supplementing the natural elements already in my body, I realized everything I needed to feel beautiful and healthy was already in me. I started Wholy Dose because this part of the beauty industry isn’t talked about – I wanted to share this feeling and change traditional beauty standards. You already have what it takes to feel beautiful and whole, from the inside and outside – We’re just here to bring that out.\n<br><br>\nWith Love, <br>\nGina N.

Our products contain clinically-proven ingredients that go through testing for safety and to ensure high purity.<br\/><br\/>All of our products are gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, sugar-free, and are keto and paleo friendly.<\/p>"}},"1588541881399":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"What Is The Source Of Your Collagen?","faqa":"<p>Our marine collagen is sourced from non-GMO tilapia and pangasius fish from Europe and is Kosher certified. Our bovine collagen is sourced from non-GMO, grass-fed, pasture-raised, antibiotic-free cattle from South America.<br\/><br\/>Both types of collagen are sustainably sourced and don&#x27;t contain any fillers or preservatives.<\/p>"}},"1588630888255":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"Is Your Collagen Clinically Proven?","faqa":"<p>Yes! The collagen we use is clinically proven to improve skin elasticity and smoothness, increase firmness and hydration, reduce wrinkles, improve hair health, and strengthen joints, bones, and muscles in as little as 4-8 weeks. Additionally, it supports nail, digestive, and immune health.<br\/><br\/>Studies have also been conducted using our collagen to show it is highly effective and highly bioavailable (easily absorbed by the body).<\/p>"}},"1588630927272":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"Is Your Collagen Highly Bioavailable?","faqa":"<p>Yes. Our collagen is highly bioavailable and goes through hydrolysis - a carefully controlled process that breaks down collagen molecules into smaller units so it can be easily digested and absorbed by the body. In fact, studies have been conducted on the collagen we use, showing that it is, indeed, easily absorbed and digested by the body.<\/p>"}},"1588630943902":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"Tell Me More About Your Hydrolysis Process","faqa":"<p>An international team of scientists uses the most advanced technology for our collagen&#x27;s hydrolysis process of sterilization, pasteurization, ultrafiltration, and crystallization to ensure validated, safe, and effective methods.<br\/><br\/>These experts are constantly seeking new and improved ways to develop and offer the highest quality of collagen so, we can provide it for you.<\/p>"}},"1588630967503":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"Why Are Your Products In Powder Form Instead Of Pills?","faqa":"<p>Simply put, we don’t like the feeling or aftertaste of swallowing pills - we also understand that a pill regimen can be easily forgotten or deliberately avoided. Additionally, capsules can take longer for the body to break down compared to powder.<\/p>"}},"1588630989952":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"Why Are There Other Key Ingredients In Addition To Collagen?","faqa":"<p>We started with collagen and went further. The science is clear about the role of collagen and its benefits, but we didn’t stop there. We took a look at how and what other ingredients can additionally help boost skin, hair, nail, and overall health so, you can reap all the beauty and health benefits in one serving - or we like to say, in one dose.<\/p>"}},"1588631018570":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"How Often Should I Use Wholy Dose Products?","faqa":"<p>For best results, we recommend using our products once to twice per day, on a daily basis.<\/p>"}},"1588631039088":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"How Much Collagen Should I Take?

It’s what’s happening on the inside that counts. Our ingredients collaboratively improve your overall health and wellbeing - happier mood, sustained energy, mental clarity, better digestion, and lessened cravings, to name a few. Generally speaking, it takes 2-4 months for our bodies to reach a new equilibrium - external factors such as skin and hair may take up to this amount of time to see a distinct difference.<br\/><br\/>That said, we suggest keeping track of your progress by taking a photo before using our products and a photo after each month of use. This will help you see your progress, side by side.<br\/><br\/>Please note, results may vary from person to person.

We always recommend you seek advice from your health care practitioner before using if you’re pregnant or nursing.<\/p>"}},"1588631119854":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"Is Your Collagen Vegan?","faqa":"<p>No, there is no direct source of vegan collagen, as collagen is inherently an animal product.

This is likely due to your body not being used to the way the amino acids in collagen are broken down by your stomach. Not to worry though! Once your stomach is used to breaking down collagen, the digestive discomfort should no longer be of concern.<\/p>"}},"1588631174170":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"What Does Unflavored Beauty Superfood Powder Taste Like?","faqa":"<p>UNFLAVORED Beauty Superfood Powder is neutral in taste and great for adding to beverages and recipes.<\/p>"}},"1588631224236":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"What Does Matcha Beauty Superfood Powder Taste Like?","faqa":"<p>MATCHA Beauty Superfood Powder tastes like green tea, but is more aromatic and fuller in flavor.<\/p>"}},"1588631237569":{"type":"products","settings":{"faqq":"What Does Beauty Tonic Superpowder Taste Like?","faqa":"<p>BEAUTY TONIC Superpowder has a slight pomegranate taste and is great for adding to water and other beverages.<\/p>"}},"1588631256280":{"type":"shipping","settings":{"faqq":"How Much Does Shipping Cost?","faqa":"<p>Standard shipping for orders: $4.95 - $6.95, unless otherwise noted.<br\/>Expedited shipping options are available for an additional fee and will be listed at checkout.<\/p>"}},"1588631272919":{"type":"shipping","settings":{"faqq":"How Long Will It Take For My Order To Arrive?","faqa":"<p>Orders ship within 1-3 business days from the date of purchase, unless otherwise noted.
